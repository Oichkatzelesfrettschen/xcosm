    This server could not verify that you are authorized to access
    the URL "<!--#echo encoding="url" var="REDIRECT_URL" -->".
    You either supplied the wrong credentials (e.g., bad password), or your
    browser doesn't understand how to supply the credentials required.

<p>
    The CDS policy for resources access is to provide open data. 
    However, in order to guarantee a high-quality service, some resources (even if they are public) require authorization.
