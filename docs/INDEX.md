## Core Framework Documents

### Primary Synthesis
- **[COSMOS_UNIFIED_TREATISE.md](papers/COSMOS_UNIFIED_TREATISE.md)** - Complete technical synthesis of both CCF and Spandrel frameworks with observational validation (November 2025, Publication-ready)

### Spandrel Framework (Type Ia Supernova Systematics)
- **[SPANDREL_V4_FINAL.md](research/SPANDREL_V4_FINAL.md)** - Current version (v4.0) with revised understanding of nucleosynthetic yields vs. flame geometry
  - **Note:** Supersedes v3.0 (see deprecation notice in SPANDREL_SYNTHESIS_V3.md)
  - **Key Finding:** Flame fractal dimension D is universal (~2.6); C/O ratio is the primary driver of SN Ia diversity

### Project Status
- **[PHASE_F_FINAL_STATUS.md](PHASE_F_FINAL_STATUS.md)** - Phase F completion status: ε = 1/4 convergence, 9/10 predictions confirmed (December 2025)
