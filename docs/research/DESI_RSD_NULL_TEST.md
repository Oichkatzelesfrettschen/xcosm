**Status:** Complete

## Executive Summary

The DESI Full-Shape analysis (arXiv:2411.12022) provides the critical "null test" for the Spandrel Framework:

**Key Result:** Growth of structure (fσ₈) is **consistent with ΛCDM and general relativity**, while geometry (BAO + SNe) shows "phantom" dark energy.

This geometry-dynamics split is **exactly what the Spandrel Framework predicts** if the phantom signal is an astrophysical artifact.

## 1. DESI DR1 Full-Shape Results

### 1.1 Cosmological Parameters

From DESI 2024 VII (arXiv:2411.12022):

| Parameter | DESI Alone | DESI + CMB | Planck ΛCDM |
|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Ωm | 0.296 ± 0.010 | 0.306 ± 0.005 | 0.315 ± 0.007 |
| σ₈ | 0.842 ± 0.034 | 0.812 ± 0.005 | 0.811 ± 0.006 |
| H₀ | 68.6 ± 0.8 | 68.4 ± 0.3 | 67.4 ± 0.5 |

### 1.2 Modified Gravity Test

The modified gravity parameter (controls clustering):
```
μ₀ = 0.11 (+0.45, -0.54)  [DESI alone]
```

**Result: Consistent with μ₀ = 0 (general relativity)**

### 1.3 RSD Precision

> "We obtained a combined precision of 4.7% on the amplitude of the redshift space distortion signal, reaching similar precision with just one year of DESI data compared to twenty years of observation from the previous generation survey."

## 2. The Geometry-Dynamics Split

### 2.1 What Each Probe Measures

| Probe | Measures | Sensitive To |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **BAO** | Distance ratios | Expansion history H(z) |
| **SNe Ia** | Luminosity distances | Expansion + Standardization |
| **RSD (fσ₈)** | Growth of structure | Gravity + Matter clustering |

### 2.2 Results by Probe

| Probe | Dark Energy Signal | w₀wₐ Preference |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| BAO alone | ΛCDM consistent | w = -1 |
| BAO + CMB | ΛCDM consistent | w = -1 |
| BAO + CMB + **SNe** | Phantom crossing | w₀ > -1, wₐ < 0 |
| **RSD (fσ₈)** | **ΛCDM consistent** | μ₀ = 0 (GR) |

### 2.3 Key Observation

If dark energy were truly evolving (w ≠ -1):
- **Phantom (w < -1)**: Suppresses structure growth at late times
- **Quintessence (w > -1)**: Enhances structure growth at late times

DESI RSD shows neither. Growth is ΛCDM-consistent.

## 3. Implications for Spandrel Framework

### 3.1 The Prediction

The Spandrel Framework predicts:
1. Geometry probes (BAO + SNe) → may show "phantom" from D(z) bias
2. Dynamics probes (RSD) → should show ΛCDM (no real DE evolution)

### 3.2 What DESI Shows

| Prediction | DESI Result | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Geometry shows phantom | (w₀ = -0.72) | CONFIRMED |
| Dynamics shows ΛCDM | (μ₀ = 0) | CONFIRMED |
| Split indicates systematic | (SNe are different) | SUPPORTED |

### 3.3 Quote from DESI

> "The galaxy full-shape analysis is **in agreement with BAO** for the background evolution and **confirms the validity of general relativity** as our theory of gravity at cosmological scales."

This is precisely what we expect if:
- The phantom signal is NOT real physics
- The phantom signal IS a systematic in SNe Ia standardization

## 4. Timeline for Key Tests

### 4.1 Current Status (DR1+DR2)

- DR1 Full-Shape: RSD consistent with ΛCDM- DR2 BAO: Phantom signal persists in SNe combination
- Combined: Geometry-dynamics split observed

### 4.2 Future Data (DR3+)

| Release | Expected | Key Test |
|---------|----------|----------|
| DESI Year 3 (2025-2026) | Full-shape with larger sample | fσ₈(z) at higher precision |
| DESI Year 5 (2027) | Complete survey | Definitive RSD vs SNe test |

### 4.3 Critical Question

If DESI Year 5 shows:
- fσ₈(z) still ΛCDM-consistent
- But SNe still prefer phantom

Then the **Spandrel Framework is strongly favored** over real dark energy evolution.

## 5. σ₈ Tension Connection

### 5.1 The S₈ Puzzle

DESI finds σ₈ = 0.842 ± 0.034, which is:
- Higher than some lensing surveys (S₈ tension)
- But consistent with Planck when combined

### 5.2 Separate from D(z)

The S₈ tension appears at z ~ 1 (before dark energy dominates) and likely relates to:
- Neutrino mass
- Modified gravity at early times

This is **distinct** from the D(z) effect, which affects SNe Ia specifically.

---

## 6. Conclusion

**The DESI RSD null test supports the Spandrel Framework:**

1. **Growth is ΛCDM-consistent** (μ₀ = 0, σ₈ = 0.84)
2. **Gravity is general relativity** (no modified gravity signal)
3. **Only SNe show phantom preference** (when combined)

This geometry-dynamics split is the signature of an **astrophysical systematic** in Type Ia supernova standardization, not new fundamental physics.
