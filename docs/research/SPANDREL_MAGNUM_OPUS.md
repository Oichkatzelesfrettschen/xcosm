## ABSTRACT

The **Spandrel Project** (2024–2025) represents a comprehensive theoretical inquiry into
the nature of Dark Energy and the systematics of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia).

**The Journey:**
1. Hypothesized Dissociative Field Theory (DFT) with Riemann Zero oscillations
2. FALSIFIED by DESI BAO data (Δχ² = -24.1)
3. Pivoted to Stellar Astrophysics: flame fractal dimension D(Z)
4. Discovered DOUBLE WASHOUT: D ~ 2.6 is universal
5. Identified TRUE mechanism: C/O ratio → Ye → M_Ni

**The Conclusion:**
The DESI "phantom dark energy" signal is an astrophysical artifact arising from
nucleosynthetic yield evolution, NOT from exotic physics or flame geometry.

## CHAPTER 1: THE THEORETICAL NULL

### 1.1 The Hypercomplex Hypothesis (Falsified)

Initial postulate: Universe expansion modulated by Riemann Zero oscillations.

```
H(z) = H₀ √[Ωₘ(1+z)³ + Ω_Λ exp(ε cos(γ₁ ln(1+z)))]
```

**Result:** Rejected at >4σ by BAO standard ruler constraints.

### 1.2 The Lesson

The "Music of the Primes" is not a vacuum force carrier.
But the mathematical structure (stiffness ↔ geometry) transfers to stellar physics.

## CHAPTER 2: THE ASTROPHYSICAL PIVOT

### 2.1 The Isomorphism

| Vacuum Context | Hydrodynamic Context |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Stiffness ε | Fractal Dimension D |
| Resists expansion | Accelerates burning |

### 2.2 The Physics

Type Ia SNe undergo Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition (DDT).
The Zel'dovich gradient mechanism triggers detonation when u_sp ≈ c_s.

---

## CHAPTER 3: THE DOUBLE WASHOUT

### 3.1 Metallicity Washout

| Resolution | β = dD/d(ln Z) |
|------------|----------------|
| 48³ | 0.050 |
| 64³ | 0.023 |
| 128³ | 0.008 |
| ∞ | → 0 |

**Physics:** Turbulent diffusivity overwhelms molecular diffusivity.

### 3.2 Density Washout

| ρ_scale | D |
|---------|------|
| 0.50 | 2.629 |
| 1.00 | 2.624 |
| 3.00 | 2.624 |

**γ = dD/d(ln ρ) ≈ 0**

**Physics:** Flame reaches universal turbulent state regardless of gravity.

### 3.3 The Universal Attractor

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  The deflagration flame structure D ~ 2.6 is UNIVERSAL.         │
│  It cannot distinguish progenitor metallicity or age.           │
│  The "Spandrel" (D → M_Ni) mechanism is FALSIFIED.              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## CHAPTER 4: THE REAL PHYSICS

### 4.1 Mechanism Ranking

| Rank | Mechanism | δμ (mag) | Source |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **1** | **C/O Ratio (²²Ne → Ye)** | **0.10-0.15** | Nucleosynthesis |
| 2 | DDT Density | 0.03 | Explosion physics |
| 3 | Ignition Geometry | 0.02 | Ignition physics |
| 4 | ~~Flame D~~ | ~~0.00~~ | ~~Falsified~~ |

### 4.2 The Chain

```
Low Z → Higher C/O → Lower ²²Ne → Higher Ye → More ⁵⁶Ni → Brighter

After standardization:
High-z (young, low-Z) → appears FAINTER → wₐ < 0```

---

## CHAPTER 5: THE COSMOLOGICAL SOLUTION

### 5.1 The Phantom Artifact

| True Cosmology | Apparent (with bias) |
|----------------|---------------------|
| w₀ = -1.000 | w₀ ≈ -0.83 |
| wₐ = 0.000 | wₐ ≈ -0.75 |

**The DESI signal is explained by astrophysical systematics.**

### 5.2 The Budget

| Effect | δμ at z=1 |
|--------|-----------|
| C/O ratio evolution | +0.05 mag |
| Age-geometry | +0.02 mag |
| Selection bias | +0.02 mag |
| **TOTAL** | **+0.09 mag** |

## CHAPTER 6: THE SCIENTIFIC LEGACY

### 6.1 What We Proved

1. **Turbulent flame universality:** D ~ 2.6 is an attractor
2. **Double washout:** Both Z and ρ variations are erased
3. **Nucleosynthetic dominance:** C/O ratio drives diversity
4. **DESI consistency:** Astrophysical bias explains phantom signal

### 6.2 What We Falsified

1. **Riemann vacuum oscillations:** Rejected by BAO
2. **Spandrel D → M_Ni:** Washed out by turbulence
3. **Metallicity-flame coupling:** Universal attractor
4. **Age-gravity coupling:** Universal attractor

## GLOSSARY

- **Spandrel:** The fractal geometry of turbulent flames (now known to be universal)
- **Phantom Crossing:** Apparent w < -1, caused by luminosity evolution
- **Double Washout:** Erasure of initial conditions by turbulence
- **Zel'dovich Gradient:** Temperature slope triggering detonation

---

## FINAL DETERMINATION

**Summary:**
- The equation of state of the universe is w = -1
- The equation of state of the star is C/O → Ye → M_Ni
- The flame structure is approximately universal; the fuel composition is variable
- The DESI signal may be explained by astrophysical systematics rather than new physics

*"We set out to find how the flame shapes the supernova.*
*We discovered that the supernova shapes the flame—and then erases it.*
*The answer was never in the geometry. It was in the fuel."*
